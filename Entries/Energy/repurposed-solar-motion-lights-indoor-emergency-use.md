# Repurposed Solar Motion Security Lights for Indoor Emergency & Daily Use

## Core Idea
Outdoor solar-powered motion security lights (commonly used for sheds/garages) can be safely repurposed indoors by routing wiring neatly under roof eaves or along exterior edges into upper wall/ceiling corners. This provides low-cost, off-grid lighting for emergencies and everyday use—especially in energy-scarce regions.

## Why It Matters
Many homes need dependable lighting without relying on the power grid. This is a practical “repomorph” because it reuses an existing mass-market product in a new context with high impact.

## Use Evolution (Morph Path)
- **Phase 1:** Emergency backup lighting (power outage / storm / night safety)
- **Phase 2:** Daily household lighting solution (hallway, entry, kitchen corner)
- **Phase 3:** Scalable community lighting pattern for underserved regions

## Simple Implementation Notes (Non-technical)
- Mount the light source high (upper corner / near ceiling) to spread light safely.
- Keep wiring tidy and protected from weather if routed along edges.
- Avoid placing where people stare directly into the light source.

## Safety Note
Avoid direct eye exposure, especially for children. Position the light above normal eye level and angle it downward.
